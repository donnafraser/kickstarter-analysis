# Kickstarting with Excel

# Overview
## In the following project, we will attempt to give you the gift of foresight. By providing interested parties with easy-to-read data and charts, we are seeking to provide a startup fundraiser with the most important pieces of information they need to achieve a predictable outcome. This report also provides a fair amount of stats regarding the success and failure rates with total amounts raised. 

# Purpose

## The report's purpose is to share real information targeting a number of fundraisers spanning multiple countries and in a variety of subjects. This data should allow readers to make informed decisions about the best time of year to launch a fundraiser, which types bring in the most donations, and what countries support the variety of subjects researched.  

# Analysis and Challenges
For our analysis, we familiarized ourselves with a variety of data collected to create a solid foundation for our potential fundraiser to make a decision regarding production of her play. We performed data analysis on a variety of subjects to help her decide if her efforts could be advantageous and allow her to proceed. We also looked at the possibility of success based on which country she would stage the performance. The anaylsis also provided data on the potential of failure.

Some attempts at analyzing the information created problems since complicated formulas were used to make calculations on percentages. The slightest typo could skew the results, and that's precisely what happened. Once the typos were found, they were all corrected and the charts began to tell a clear story of the success rate and best time to launch a fundraising campaign. As a result, we were able to provide useful charts to visualize which categories were most popular and succesful. This can be seen in the example below:

# Conclusions for Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Through using our data analysis, two things are well-defined:

1. The best time of year to launch a fundraiser is spring
2. The winter months are not favorable to fundraiser launches, particularly, January

# What About Outcomes Based on Goals?
A piece of the analysis disclosed something quite surprising. I believe this revelation warrants some data collection and analysis itself, but purely for curiosity only.

We show raising a small amount of funding could be easy if you had the right subject. For most, donating to a worthwhile cause with a goal of $1,000 isn't too crazy. What if that amount was $35-45,000? How generous would you feel?

Apparently, our analysis concluded that the two most successful fundraising amounts were in the $1,000 range with many failures in between to see success again starting at $35,000 up to $45,000. Odd, indeed! 

# Limitations
Some limitations I noted were based on the small amount of data collected on various categories. There wasn't much for technology and games which was disappointing to me. But that definintely limited the scope of anaylsis we could target.
